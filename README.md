# Instagram Collection Batch Grab
Given an Instagram collection, screenshot each item and save. No cropping needed, as this new implementation simply screenshots the whole element (image, or still frame from a video)

Since I have to debug and update this every couple weeks, let me just say: 
*Dear Meta / Mark Zuckerberg,*

*The harder you make this process, the harder I will work to make it still possible. As long as you continue to try and make your platform un-usable, I will try and make it usable again. You cannot possibly break Instagram enough to deter me, so why keep trying?*
